## Dependencies <a name="01"></a>

2. [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/download/): `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install taskwarrior`

## Summary

I needed two things in my project management so I could could manage my projects
and not manage my project management:

1. Automation
2. Iteration

**Automation** has enabled me to do the same thing over and again where it was
just redunancy. This tool is totally customizable to setup your taskwarrior
projects with whatever specifications you prefer.

**Iteration** has allowed me to see what is and what is not working. Without
truly iterative functionality, it is impossible to test a methods efficacy.
As your process changes, you can modify project automation script.

## Walk Through <a name="03"></a>



1. What is taskwarrior?
2. How is it process agnostic?
3. Task ID's and dependencies are what define priorities.
